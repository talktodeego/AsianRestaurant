# üçú Asian Restaurant Mockup üçú

To challenge myself, I have decided that in the next three months, I will be posting some challenges that I will undertake.

To choose what I will be doing, I am looking for interesting and visually appealing projects that are posted in the [FIGMA Community](https://www.figma.com/community/), and I will replicate them.

For my first project, I chose a minimalist, cool, and beautiful design that was created and posted by "XIDE" on the FIGMA Community [XIDE Hensui - Business Landing Page UI Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1227911463600022110/XIDE-Hensui---Business-Landing-Page-UI-Template)
