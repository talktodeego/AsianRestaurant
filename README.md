# üçú Asian Restaurant Mockup üçú

In ordering to challenging myself, I've decided that in the next 3 months I will be posting some challenges that I will be doing.

To choose what I will be doing, i'm looking for cool and beautiful projects that are posting in [FIGMA Community](https://www.figma.com/community/) and I will be replicated then.

My first project was that minimalist, cool and beautiful project that was created and posted by "XIDE" on figma community [XIDE Hensui - Business Landing Page UI Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1227911463600022110/XIDE-Hensui---Business-Landing-Page-UI-Template)
